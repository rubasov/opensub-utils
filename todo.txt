redesign
    the decision that subtitles are distributed in a zip file should be hidden
        introduce concept of (interface for) SearchResult(List)
            this concept should be used by both UserAgent and SubtitleGetter
        turn SubtitleArchive into SubtitleCollection
        turn extract_archive into SubtitleCollection.get
        SearchResult ?= SubtitleCollection
    how well your design hid that the search interface is suboptimal?
        think about the ideal file-by-file search
    consider using xml-rpc search
packaging
    improve setup.py
